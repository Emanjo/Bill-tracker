# JavaScript full stack test-project
A simple full stack project with JavaScript.

***

Currently implemented parts:
- Simple express API that handles posts-entrypoint (POST, GET, DELETE)
- Simple UI for adding and deleting posts.

### Future plans:
I want to use this base to make an application for storing books.

#### Functionality:
- Enter the books you own
- Enter the books youâ€™d like to buy
- Store the book info, images
